* If you have an older PC, you might want to upgrade your operating system at some point. An upgraded OS can make your computing experience smoother so you can get your daily tasks done more quickly.

* So, let’s say you are currently bogged down with a Windows 7 OS on your PC but you’d like to load and run Windows 10 using a USB device. How do you do that?

* Luckily, the days of using discs to boot software are long gone. Today you have a much more convenient option: you can boot right from a USB drive. A Windows 10 USB boot isn’t as complicated as you might think.

* We’ve broken down the steps in this user-friendly guide so you’ll be on your way to enjoying your new software in no time at all.


## Before you get started


* As you may already know, an operating system is crucial to keeping your computer systems running.
It helps to process and manage your PC’s memory as well as its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer so you can carry out behind-the-scenes tasks. 

* An older operating system won’t mean it’s the end of the road for your computer, but you’ll eventually stop getting security updates and receiving support. So, in most cases, it’s in your best interest to upgrade.



##  USB drive

Before you boot from your USB drive, you’ll need to prepare with the right knowledge and materials, just like any other DIY project.
First, you’ll want to invest in a USB flash drive that has at least 16GB of space which should give you some breathing room in terms of storage. However, if you’re able to invest in a 32GB USB drive, that is an even more optimal amount of space for this project.


##  License

* Next, you’ll want to obtain a license to run the Windows 10 operating system. You can either purchase a Windows license outright or simply use one you have under your account already. After doing so, utilize a Windows USB utility to configure the USB drive with Windows 10.

* One drawback to booting Windows 10 from a USB device is that the operating system will be slower than it would be if it ran off your regular hard drive. With that said, it’s still a good option if you want a new OS.

* Not sure how to configure your USB drive? Microsoft conveniently offers Windows to Go which can create a bootable Windows USB drive easily.

* Unfortunately, Windows to Go is only compatible with Education and Enterprise versions of Windows 10 and needs an official Window to Go drive to work [2]. There’s also another option you can use called WinToUSB which can make a bootable drive from any USB and any OS.

* Now, you can move on to actually booting your Windows 10 operating system from your USB flash drive.
